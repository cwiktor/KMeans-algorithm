# KMeans-algorithm

A console program that clusters a given set of points using the k-means method.

The application downloads:
  1. date: CSV (comma separated) file with each line corresponds to one point.
  2. k: number of clusters to be defined.
  
The application executes the KMeans algorithm for the given data and prints the number of the allocated cluster sequentially for each input row.
